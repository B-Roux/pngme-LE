This repository, signified by the "-LE" suffix, is a *learning experience*. This project is the product of a tutorial, challenge, proof of concept, demonstration, prototype, etc. wherein the ultimate goal is not to produce code suitable for a production environment.

That said, under the terms of the attatched license(s) you may use this project however you wish.

## About

This is my implementation of the "[pngme](https://picklenerd.github.io/pngme_book/)" project ([repository](https://github.com/picklenerd/pngme_book)), meant as a "first project" for those trying to learn the Rust programming language after having read through "[The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)."

Please visit these upstream resources for any further information on this project.

## Licensing

Since the pngme project repository does not license the code they provide, and since I make no distinction between code I wrote and code I got from them, I will not be licensing any code in this repository, sorry. 

If you wish to use code found in this repository, open an issue in the pngme upstream and ask them to license their code for distribution/reuse, after which I will try to work out a compatible licensing scheme for this repository.

Happy Rusting!
